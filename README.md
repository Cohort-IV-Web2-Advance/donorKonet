AsyncNote Homepage (HTML Only) – Phase I

📌 Project Description

This project is a simple homepage for AsyncNote, built using only HTML.
AsyncNote is an asynchronous collaborative documentation platform designed to help teams turn notes into structured, long-lasting knowledge.

This phase focuses strictly on understanding HTML structure and semantics before introducing styling or interactivity.

🎯 Project Goals

Practice writing semantic HTML

Understand modern web page structure

Learn team collaboration using GitHub

Prepare the foundation for future CSS and JavaScript integration

Translate a product idea (AsyncNote) into a real webpage structure

🛠️ Technologies Used

⚠️ Note:
No CSS or JavaScript is used in this phase.
This is intentional to focus on structure, not styling.
